          <p><em>Digital Artist, Musician and Founder of <strong><a href="https://www.thesaviourproject.ca/">Saviour Project</a></strong>.</em></p>
          <p>I am a digital artist and musician from Ontario Canada. Born and raised in Ridgetown, i found the love of art and music at an early age.<br>
             At the age of 16 i began my journey as a self-taught musician. Begining with 6 string guitar, i moved into keyboard and audio mixing from there.<br>
             As a physical or classic artist i began with sketching and moved into on-paper graffiti which evolved into using spray can art tagging abandoned buildings and walls in the community.<br>
             In the last 5 years I have found a new love in digital artforms. Using an Ipad and Procreate i started cartooning and digital oil painting. On the discovery of web3 and blockchain<br>
             I began expiramenting and working with NFT projects as an artist and eventually founded my own project, <strong>Saviour Project</strong>. Focusing on helping those suffering with mental health we set out<br>
             to construct metaverse hubs for those seeking a new avanue of medical attention as well as education, which is currently what i have been working on for the past 9 months to bring to fruition. </p>
